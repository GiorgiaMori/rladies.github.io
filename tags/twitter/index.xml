TL; DR In February 2021 I tweeted to a daunting &amp;gt;20k followers by curating for @WeAreLadies on Twitter. This was great opportunity to share knowledge, interact with others, and learn something in return, ultimately cultivating new connections and collaborations. From preparation to fruition, I hope this post helps you confidently enroll as a curator!</description></item><item><title>IWD 2019 Twitter Action</title><link>https://www.rladies.org/blog/2019-03-25-blog_iwdtwitter_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.rladies.org/blog/2019-03-25-blog_iwdtwitter_2019/</guid><description>Every year on March 8th, the world celebrates International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day (IWD). Although this date has different ways of celebration, it has one point in common - the fight for gender equality. The previous year, in 2018, an enthusiast R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; group took the initiative for a massive project to tweet about all the profiles registered in the R-ladies directory, throughout 8th March 2018. In February this year, the year 2019, Yanina proposed to follow their lead and tweet about all the R-Ladies Chapters, throughout 8th March 2019.</description></item><item><title>3.
