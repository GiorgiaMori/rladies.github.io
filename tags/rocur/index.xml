TL; DR In February 2021 I tweeted to a daunting &amp;gt;20k followers by curating for @WeAreLadies on Twitter. This was great opportunity to share knowledge, interact with others, and learn something in return, ultimately cultivating new connections and collaborations. From preparation to fruition, I hope this post helps you confidently enroll as a curator!</description></item></channel></rss>
