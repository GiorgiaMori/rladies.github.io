For this, R-Ladies as a global organisation helps with technical infrastructure and a network the organisers can rely on for help and guidance if they need it.
In addition, the Global team coordinates activities that span all chapters. These activities ensure the chapter and R-Ladies around the world can access the international network and aid that exists for the community.</description></item><item><title>Events</title><link>https://rladies-dev.netlify.app/activities/events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies-dev.netlify.app/activities/events/</guid><description/></item><item><title>International Womens Day Campaigns</title><link>https://rladies-dev.netlify.app/activities/iwd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies-dev.netlify.app/activities/iwd/</guid><description>R-Ladies Global has coordinated International Women Day actions to encourage more people from gender minorities to participate in the community on Twitter and to promote people in the community.

The main objective of the R-Ladies Mentoring Program is to help organisers conduct successful meetups and keep their chapters active.
Organizing an R-Ladies chapter involves a series of tasks that can feel overwhelming to a new organiser. However, a number of experienced R-Ladies organisers are willing to mentor new ones and provide some great advice.
For mentors, this is an opportunity to help build the community, learn about the realities of other chapters, gain experience as a mentor, and contributing to R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; goals.</description></item><item><title>Twitter campaigns</title><link>https://rladies-dev.netlify.app/activities/twitter-campaigns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies-dev.netlify.app/activities/twitter-campaigns/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
