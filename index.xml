The main objective of the R-Ladies Mentoring Program is to help organisers conduct successful meetups and keep their chapters active.
Organizing an R-Ladies chapter involves a series of tasks that can feel overwhelming to a new organiser. However, a number of experienced R-Ladies organisers are willing to mentor new ones and provide some great advice.
For mentors, this is an opportunity to help build the community, learn about the realities of other chapters, gain experience as a mentor, and contributing to R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; goals.</description></item><item><title>Mission</title><link>https://www.rladies.org/about-us/mission/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.rladies.org/about-us/mission/</guid><description>R-LADIES IS A WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROMOTE GENDER DIVERSITY IN THE R COMMUNITY.
The R community suffers from an under-representation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users (see recent stats).
As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently under-represented in the R community.</description></item><item><title>R-Ladies Directory form</title><link>https://www.rladies.org/directory-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.rladies.org/directory-update/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Twitter campaigns</title><link>https://www.rladies.org/activities/twitter-campaigns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.rladies.org/activities/twitter-campaigns/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
